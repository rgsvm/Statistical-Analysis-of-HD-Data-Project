# Statistical-Analysis-of-HD-Data-Project
Introduction
The Vélib' Métropole Statistical-Analysis of High Dimensional Data Project focuses on analyzing the availability of bikes and terminals within the Vélib' Métropole shared bicycle service. This service operates across 55 municipalities in the Métropole du Grand Paris area, providing sustainable transportation options for urban commuters.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Paris Open Data portal and is provided by Smovengo / Syndicat Autolib' Vélib' Métropole (© 2018 Smovengo / Syndicat Autolib' Vélib' Métropole). It consists of real-time data on bike and terminal availability, accessed through the Vélib' Métropole API.

Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to visualize and analyze the availability of bikes and terminals within the Vélib' Métropole service. By exploring trends and patterns in bike usage, we aim to better understand urban mobility patterns, promote sustainable transportation options, and inform decisions related to urban infrastructure planning and improvement.
